TweetLanes-design
=================

a SparkleShared repository for working together on all things design-related (UI, art, etc.) for the TweetLanes Twitter client for Android

## SparkleShare

Users of this repository use [SparkleShare](http://sparkleshare.org/).
You should too! It's great for working on documents together, and is
available on all the major desktop computing platforms
(Linux/Mac/Windows) at no cost, as it's free and open source.

As SparkleShare uses git to do its syncing magic, you _can_ use pretty
much any git client too, if you're a casual user of this repository (or
if you don't mind typing a bunch of commands instead of just saving your
files directly).

## Usage

No matter the tool, please export your work to an `export` directory in
a PNG format so all can see what you're working on. When possible, it
would be nice to also export to a standars-based editable format (such
as PDF, SVG, OpenDocument, etc.) that anyone can use (especially for
software that costs money, so others have no restrictions editing it).

Overall, when contributing, remember these three rules: 

1. Be nice
2. Make great stuff
3. Have fun!
